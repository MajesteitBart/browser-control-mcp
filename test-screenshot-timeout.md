# Screenshot Timeout Fix Test

## Summary
Fixed the screenshot timeout issue by implementing operation-specific timeouts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `waitForResponse` method in `/mcp-server/browser-api.ts`
- Added optional `timeoutMs` parameter
- Uses provided timeout or defaults to `EXTENSION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS` (1000ms)
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 2. Updated `takeScreenshot` method
- Now uses 30-second timeout (30000ms) instead of default 1-second timeout
- Added explanatory comment about why screenshots need longer timeouts

### 3. Added documentation comments
- Explained that screenshot operations need longer timeouts due to:
  - Scrolling through large pages
  - Waiting for content to load between scrolls
  - Stitching multiple screenshots together

## Implementation Details

**Before:**
- All operations used 1000ms timeout
- Screenshots failed with "Timed out waiting for response" on large pages
- Background scrolling continued after timeout error

**After:**
- Quick operations: 1000ms timeout (unchanged)
- Screenshot operations: 30000ms timeout
- Full-page screenshots can complete without timeout errors

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All 30 existing tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Expected Results
- ✅ Full-page screenshots complete without timeout errors
- ✅ Single viewport screenshots work quickly
- ✅ Other operations (scroll, click, etc.) maintain quick response times
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API

The critical screenshot timeout issue has been resolved!
