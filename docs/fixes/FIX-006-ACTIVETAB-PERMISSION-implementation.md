# FIX-006: ActiveTab Permission Model Fix for Screenshot Functionality

## Problem Summary

The screenshot functionality was failing with "Missing activeTab permission" errors despite `activeTab` being declared in the manifest. This occurred because **Manifest V3 requires user interaction to activate the activeTab permission**, but MCP server calls are programmatic (no user interaction).

## Error Details

```
Full page capture failed, falling back to viewport capture: Error: Missing activeTab permission
Both full page and fallback screenshot capture failed: Missing activeTab permission
```

## Root Cause Analysis

In Manifest V3, the `activeTab` permission only becomes "active" when:
- User clicks the extension icon
- User invokes extension via keyboard shortcut  
- User interacts with the extension

Since MCP server calls are programmatic (no user interaction), `activeTab` is never activated, causing `browser.tabs.captureVisibleTab()` to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed activeTab Permission Dependency

**Before:**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "activeTab",
    "history",
    "find", 
    "storage",
    "scripting"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>",
    "ws://localhost:*/",
    "ws://127.0.0.1:*/"
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "history",
    "find",
    "storage", 
    "scripting"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fixed Host Permissions Issues

- **Removed WebSocket URLs from host_permissions**: WebSocket URLs (`ws://localhost:*/`, `ws://127.0.0.1:*/`) don't belong in `host_permissions` and were causing manifest processing warnings
- **Kept WebSocket URLs in CSP**: WebSocket permissions remain in the `content_security_policy` where they belong

### 3. Updated Screenshot Implementation

Modified `captureSingleScreenshot()` method in `message-handler.ts`:

- **Removed activeTab dependency**: No longer relies on `activeTab` permission activation
- **Uses host_permissions**: Leverages `<all_urls>` host permission for programmatic access
- **Improved error handling**: Cleaner error propagation without activeTab-specific checks

## Key Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`firefox-extension/manifest.json`**:
   - Removed `activeTab` from permissions
   - Removed WebSocket URLs from host_permissions
   - Bumped version to 1.3.4

2. **`firefox-extension/package.json`**:
   - Updated version to 1.3.4

3. **`firefox-extension/message-handler.ts`**:
   - Updated `captureSingleScreenshot()` to work without activeTab
   - Simplified error handling
   - Added tab query logic for better window targeting

## Technical Details

### Permission Model Change

**Old Model (Broken):**
- Relied on `activeTab` permission
- Required user interaction to activate
- Failed for programmatic MCP calls

**New Model (Working):**
- Uses `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`
- Works for programmatic access
- No user interaction required

### Screenshot Flow

1. **Get active tab** in specified window using `browser.tabs.query()`
2. **Capture screenshot** using `browser.tabs.captureVisibleTab(windowId, options)`
3. **Host permissions** allow access without activeTab activation
4. **Return image data** as base64 string

## Testing Results

- ✅ All 52 tests passing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No manifest warnings
- ✅ Screenshot functionality restored for programmatic access

## Verification Steps

1. **Load extension** in Firefox
2. **Check manifest warnings**: Should be resolved
3. **Test screenshot via MCP**: Should work without user interaction
4. **Verify host permissions**: `<all_urls>` provides necessary access

## Security Considerations

- **Reduced attack surface**: Removed unnecessary `activeTab` permission
- **Maintained functionality**: `<all_urls>` host permission provides same access
- **WebSocket security**: CSP still controls WebSocket connections appropriately

## Future Considerations

This fix aligns the extension with Manifest V3 best practices:
- Uses appropriate permission types for their intended purposes
- Removes dependency on user-activated permissions for programmatic features
- Maintains security while enabling automation functionality
