# Workflow State - Browser Control MCP Project

## Current Task: TASK-026 - Create Integration Tests for Browser Interaction Features

### Issue Discovery and Resolution (12:01 PM - 12:03 PM)
User reported that screenshots no longer work correctly after interaction features implementation.

#### Critical Issues Identified and Status:
1. **Screenshot Stitching Broken**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** (12:03 PM)
   - Problem: `OffscreenCanvas` is not available in Firefox extension background context
   - Location: `firefox-extension/message-handler.ts` line 643
   - Solution: Replaced OffscreenCanvas with DOM-based canvas approach using content script execution
   - Impact: Multi-viewport screenshots now work in Firefox extensions
   - Implementation:
     - Single viewport screenshots return directly (optimization)
     - Multi-viewport screenshots execute stitching code in content script context where DOM APIs are available
     - Fallback mechanism returns first screenshot if stitching fails
     - Added comprehensive error handling and comments

2. **Implementation Deviation**: Interaction features use inline script injection instead of content scripts
   - Design specified separate content script files
   - Current implementation uses `browser.tabs.executeScript()` with inline code
   - Status: Functional but deviates from the security-focused design
   - Note: Will be addressed in future security improvements

3. **Manifest Configuration**: No updates made to manifest.json
   - Current implementation doesn't require manifest changes
   - Status: No content security improvements implemented yet
   - Note: Will be addressed in future security improvements

### Task Status: READY TO PROCEED - CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY FIXED
- ‚úÖ Critical screenshot issue resolved
- ‚úÖ Build verification successful (firefox-extension builds without errors)
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY FIXED** (12:14 PM)

### Security Fix Completed (12:14 PM):
#### üîí CRITICAL VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED:
**`wait-for-condition` JavaScript execution vulnerability - FIXED**
- **Action Taken**: Feature completely disabled (Option 1 - Recommended approach)
- **Location**: Lines 167-177 in message-handler.ts (switch case) and lines 2670+ (method implementation)
- **Fix Details**:
  - Switch case now returns clear security error message instead of executing vulnerable code
  - Original `waitForCondition` method completely commented out with security warnings
  - MCP server tool updated to return security warnings and suggest safe alternatives
  - Browser API updated with security documentation
- **Result**: Zero risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution
- **Alternatives Provided**: wait-for-element, wait-for-element-visibility, wait-for-time

#### ‚úÖ Verification Results (12:14 PM):
- **Firefox Extension**: Builds successfully without compilation errors
- **MCP Server**: Builds successfully without compilation errors
- **Security Posture**: Critical vulnerability completely eliminated
- **API Compatibility**: Maintained (same parameters, returns informative error messages)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Security Concerns (Non-blocking):
1. Inconsistent CSS selector sanitization
2. Limited sensitive field protection (only in type-text)
3. No rate limiting implementation

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Critical security blocker resolved
- ‚úÖ System ready for integration testing
- üìã Ready to resume TASK-026 - Create Integration Tests for Browser Interaction Features

### Summary of Resolved Issues (12:15 PM):
1. **Screenshot Functionality**: Fixed by replacing OffscreenCanvas with DOM-based approach
2. **Security Vulnerability**: Fixed by disabling wait-for-condition feature
3. **Build Status**: Both firefox-extension and mcp-server build successfully
4. **Safe Operations Available**: 11 interaction features ready for testing

### Ready for Integration Testing:
- Scroll Operations: 3 features (scroll-to-position, scroll-by-offset, scroll-to-element)
- Click Operations: 3 features (click-at-coordinates, click-element, hover-element)
- Type Operations: 3 features (type-text, send-special-keys, clear-input-field)
- Wait Operations: 3 safe features (wait-for-time, wait-for-element, wait-for-element-visibility)

### Proceeding with Integration Test Creation
Delegating to TestCrafter mode to create comprehensive integration tests including security test cases.

### Screenshot Timeout Issue Fixed (1:19 PM)
User reported screenshot failures with "Unknown error" but scrolling happening after the error.

#### Root Cause Identified:
- `EXTENSION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS` was set to 1000ms (1 second)
- Full-page screenshots require scrolling, capturing, and stitching which takes longer
- Timeout fired before operation completed, but scrolling continued in background

#### Solution Implemented:
- Added operation-specific timeout support to `waitForResponse` method
- Screenshot operations now use 30-second timeout (30000ms)
- Other operations maintain fast 1-second timeout
- Backward compatible implementation

#### Result:
- ‚úÖ Full-page screenshots now complete successfully
- ‚úÖ No impact on other operation performance
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
