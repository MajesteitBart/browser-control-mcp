# Screenshot Stitching Refinement Task Context

## Task ID: SCREENSHOT-STITCH-REFINE-001

## Issue Description
User has provided feedback showing a visible stitching artifact in the captured screenshot. There's a horizontal seam/line visible in the middle portion of the screenshot where different segments were joined together.

## Visual Evidence
- Screenshot file: `screenshot-1748435891845-3.png`
- Issue: Visible horizontal line/seam in the stitched image
- Location: Middle portion of the screenshot
- Impact: Breaks visual continuity and affects image quality

## Root Cause Analysis Required
The current content-boundary-aware segmentation and overlap detection implementation still has issues:

1. **Overlap Detection**: May not be properly identifying and removing overlapping content
2. **Segment Boundaries**: Content-aware segmentation might not be finding optimal break points
3. **Canvas Drawing**: Potential issues with how segments are positioned and blended on the canvas
4. **Timing Issues**: Dynamic content loading might be causing inconsistent captures

## Technical Areas to Investigate

### 1. Content-Aware Segmentation (`getContentAwareSegments()`)
- Review CSS selector logic for finding natural break points
- Analyze segment height calculations
- Check for edge cases in content detection

### 2. Overlap Detection and Removal
- Verify overlap calculation logic in `executeStitchingInContentScript()`
- Review canvas drawing coordinates and source rectangles
- Check for proper handling of segment boundaries

### 3. Canvas Stitching Algorithm
- Analyze sequential drawing approach
- Review coordinate calculations for segment positioning
- Check for proper handling of different segment sizes

### 4. Timing and Synchronization
- Review scroll timing and wait mechanisms
- Check for proper content loading detection
- Analyze dynamic content handling

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the specific stitching artifact
2. **Algorithm Refinement**: Improved segmentation and overlap detection
3. **Enhanced Testing**: Additional test cases for edge cases
4. **Validation**: Successful screenshot capture without visible seams

## Acceptance Criteria
- Screenshot stitching produces seamless images without visible horizontal lines
- Content boundaries are properly detected and respected
- Overlap detection and removal works correctly
- Canvas drawing produces smooth transitions between segments
- All existing functionality remains intact

## Context Files to Review
- `firefox-extension/message-handler.ts` - Core stitching implementation
- `firefox-extension/extension-config.ts` - Configuration settings
- `docs/reviews/frontend-review-screenshot-stitching-analysis-2025-05-28.md` - Previous analysis
- `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md` - Current project state

## Priority: High
This is a critical quality issue that affects the core functionality of the screenshot stitching feature.
