# Task Context: TASK-015 - Update Tests for File Saving Functionality

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: TASK-015
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Testing
- **Assigned Mode**: TestCrafter

## Context
The MCP server now has file saving functionality implemented for screenshots. When the SCREENSHOT_DIR environment variable is set, screenshots are saved to the filesystem and the file path is included in the response. This feature needs comprehensive test coverage.

## Current Implementation Details

### File Saving Feature
- Located in: `mcp-server/src/browser-api.ts`
- Environment variable: `SCREENSHOT_DIR`
- File naming convention: `screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_SSS.{format}`
- Supports PNG and JPEG formats
- Returns file path in response along with base64 data
- Gracefully handles errors and falls back to base64-only response

### Key Components to Test
1. Environment variable configuration (lines 17-26 in browser-api.ts)
2. File system operations (saveScreenshotToFile method, lines 266-295)
3. Directory creation logic
4. Error handling scenarios
5. Response structure with filePath
6. Backward compatibility

## Test Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
1. **Environment Configuration Tests**
   - Test SCREENSHOT_DIR validation
   - Test directory creation when it doesn't exist
   - Test handling of invalid directory paths

2. **File System Operation Tests**
   - Mock fs operations for saveScreenshotToFile
   - Test successful file saving
   - Test file naming generation
   - Test both PNG and JPEG formats

3. **Error Scenario Tests**
   - Directory permission errors
   - Disk space errors
   - Invalid base64 data
   - File write failures
   - Fallback to base64-only response

4. **Response Structure Tests**
   - Verify filePath is included when file saving succeeds
   - Verify backward compatibility (base64 data still present)
   - Verify proper error handling in responses

### Integration Tests Needed
1. Complete flow test with actual file system
2. Test with various screenshot formats and qualities
3. Test concurrent screenshot operations
4. Test with large screenshots (boundary conditions)

## Existing Test Structure
- Test files are in: `mcp-server/__tests__/`
- Main test file to update: `mcp-server/__tests__/browser-api.test.ts`
- Test utilities: `mcp-server/__tests__/test-utils.ts`

## Dependencies
- Jest testing framework
- File system mocking libraries
- Existing test infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All new functionality has test coverage
2. All error scenarios are tested
3. Backward compatibility is verified through tests
4. Tests are well-documented and maintainable
5. All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
6. Code coverage remains above 80%

## Notes
- The file saving functionality was implemented in TASK-012 and TASK-014
- Security validations were added to prevent path traversal attacks
- The feature maintains full backward compatibility
