# Browser Control MCP - Port Availability Bug Fix

## Current Request: Fix Port Availability Issue
**Request ID**: PORT-FIX-001
**Date**: 2025-05-26
**Status**: Completed
**User Goal**: Resolve "All available ports are in use" error preventing MCP server startup
**Directus Task ID**: 11

## Issue Analysis

### Problem Description
The MCP server fails to initialize with the error:
```
Browser API init error Error: All available ports are in use at BrowserAPI.init
```

### Root Cause
- The current implementation only checks 2 ports: 8081 and 8082
- Both ports are currently occupied, preventing WebSocket server startup
- No graceful port cleanup on server shutdown
- Limited port range provides insufficient fallback options

### Impact
- MCP server cannot start
- Firefox extension cannot connect
- Screenshot functionality and all browser control features are unavailable

## Solution Plan

### TASK-001: Expand Port Range
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Increase available port range from 2 to 10 ports
**Changes**:
- ✅ Updated WS_PORTS array to include 8081-8090
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

### TASK-002: Improve Port Cleanup
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Enhance server shutdown to properly release ports
**Changes**:
- ✅ Improved close() method implementation with comprehensive cleanup
- ✅ Added proper WebSocket server and connection cleanup
- ✅ Added cleanup of pending extension requests
- ✅ Added detailed logging for cleanup process

### TASK-003: Add Diagnostic Logging
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Add better error reporting and port status logging
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added logging for which ports are being checked
- ✅ Report which specific ports are in use
- ✅ Provide actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ Added port selection confirmation logging

### TASK-004: Implement Port Recovery
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Add timeout and robust error handling for port checking
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added 2-second timeout for port checks to prevent hanging
- ✅ Improved error handling for permission denied and other errors
- ✅ Added exception handling for port binding attempts
- ✅ Enhanced port checking reliability

## Implementation Strategy
1. Fix immediate port range issue (quick fix)
2. Improve cleanup and diagnostics (robustness)
3. Add recovery mechanisms (reliability)
4. Test with multiple concurrent instances

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Port range expansion
- **Medium Risk**: Cleanup improvements, logging changes
- **High Risk**: None identified

## Success Criteria
- MCP server starts successfully even when some ports are occupied
- Proper cleanup on shutdown prevents port leakage
- Clear error messages help diagnose connection issues
- Multiple MCP server instances can run concurrently when needed

## Implementation Results
**Date Completed**: 2025-05-26 23:08
**Changes Made**:
1. **Expanded Port Range**: Increased from 2 ports (8081-8082) to 10 ports (8081-8090)
2. **Enhanced Cleanup**: Comprehensive resource cleanup in close() method
3. **Improved Logging**: Detailed port checking and selection logging
4. **Robust Port Checking**: Added timeouts and better error handling
5. **Built Successfully**: TypeScript compilation completed without errors

## Files Modified:
- `mcp-server/browser-api.ts`: Port range expansion, logging, cleanup improvements
- `mcp-server/util.ts`: Enhanced port checking with timeout and error handling

The MCP server should now start successfully even when some ports are occupied, and provide clear diagnostic information if issues persist.
